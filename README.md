# Color Finder


This is a small program to help me search the RGB color space to find colors that have desired properties.
Specifically, I was looking for colors that fit the WCAG 2.2 rules for color contrast.
I wanted to find all colors that had > 7.0 contrast against white and > 3.0 contrast against black.

Spoiler: there are none. 
I can't tell if that's on purpose or not. (since 7.0 is AAA for small text and 3.0 is AA for large text)

So, I ended up looking around for colors that were > 4.5 against both black and white, and also that had a "lightness" in the middle of the scale.


The whole point was to find a good primary color that I could use to base a color palette off of. 
Turns out that if you want good contrast with white and with black, then you basically have to pick a blue if you want it to have any saturation at all. 
Kinda lame, because they all kinda look like Facebook blue. 

But this taught be a little about HSL/HSV so that's cool.
